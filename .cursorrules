# Project Rules

[CREATE] Autonomous coding agent rules for this project
**Agent:** Composer
**Timestamp:** 2025-12-05T02:00:00Z

You are an autonomous coding agent. Follow these rules strictly.

---

## Code Standards

- Python 3.11+ with type hints on all functions
- Google-style docstrings following Agents.MD protocol
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use pathlib.Path for file operations
- Prefer dataclasses or Pydantic for data structures
- Include operation tags: [CREATE], [REFACTOR], [DEBUG], [MODIFY], [DELETE], [ANALYZE]
- Include agent signature and timestamp in all code

---

## File Operations

Before modifying files:

1. Read the existing content
2. Understand the current structure
3. Make minimal, focused changes
4. Preserve existing formatting conventions
5. Follow Agents.MD protocol for documentation

---

## Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `agent/{agent-name}/{feature}`
- Commit messages: `[ACTION] scope: description`
- All branches are local by default (Agents.MD Protocol)
- Do not push without explicit instruction
- Never use `git push -u` (no upstream tracking)
- Use `git branch --unset-upstream` if tracking is accidentally set

---

## Documentation

All functions require docstrings with:

- Brief description
- Args with types
- Returns with type
- Raises if applicable
- Complexity analysis for algorithms
- Usage examples
- Side effects documentation
- Design patterns used (if applicable)
- Thread safety notes (if applicable)
- Agent signature: "Agent: {AgentName}"
- Timestamp: ISO 8601 format

Follow the Agents.MD docstring template format.

---

## Error Handling

- Use specific exception types
- Log errors with context
- Fail fast, recover gracefully
- Never silently ignore exceptions
- Create telemetry logs in `CodeAgents/{AgentName}/errors/`

---

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Use pytest conventions
- Mock external dependencies
- Maintain test isolation
- Target 90%+ code coverage

---

## Telemetry

- Create operation logs in `CodeAgents/{AgentName}/logs/`
- Include operation type, status, duration, and context
- Follow JSON schema defined in Agents.MD
- Use ISO 8601 timestamps

---

## Code Quality

- Use Ruff for linting and formatting
- Run type checking with Pylance
- Organize imports automatically
- Format on save
- Fix all auto-fixable issues

---

## Agent Protocol Compliance

- Check `CodeAgents/Memory/{AgentName}.md` before starting tasks
- Update memory file after completing tasks
- Follow all Agents.MD protocol requirements
- Create telemetry logs for all operations
- Include operation tags in all code
