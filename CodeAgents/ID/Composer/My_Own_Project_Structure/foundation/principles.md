## Core Principles

### 1. Validation-First
- Every structure must be validated
- Quality gates at every level
- Automated health checks

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with minimal viable structure
- Add complexity only when needed
- Avoid premature optimization

### 3. Self-Documentation
- Structure tells its own story
- Embedded metadata
- Clear naming conventions

### 4. Evolution-Friendly
- Track changes explicitly
- Document decisions
- Support experimentation

### 5. Metrics-Driven
- Measure what matters
- Data-informed decisions
- Continuous improvement

## Application

These principles guide all structure creation and modification decisions.
