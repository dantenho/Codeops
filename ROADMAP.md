# 🗺️ Project Roadmap

## 🚀 Phase 1: Foundation & Refactoring (Current)

- [x] **Refactor File Structure**: Move logs and reports to agent-specific directories.
- [x] **Establish Protocols**: Enforce `Agents.MD` compliance.
- [ ] **Logging System**: Implement structured logging for all agents.
- [ ] **Memory Initialization**: Create memory files for all active agents.

## 🧠 Phase 2: Intelligence & Memory

- [ ] **ChromaDB Integration**: Set up local vector database for long-term memory.
- [ ] **RAG Engine**: Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context-aware responses.
- [ ] **CUDA Acceleration**: Optimize vector operations using GPU support.
- [ ] **Knowledge Ingestion**: Ingest documentation and code into the vector store.

## 🤖 Phase 3: Agent Autonomy

- [ ] **Agent Swarm**: Enable multi-agent collaboration (GrokIA, Gemini, etc.).
- [ ] **Self-Learning**: Implement feedback loops for agents to improve over time.
- [ ] **Task Orchestration**: Create a central manager for assigning tasks to agents.

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Production Readiness

- [ ] **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate testing and deployment.
- [ ] **Security Hardening**: Audit code and dependencies.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize critical paths.
