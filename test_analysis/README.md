# CodeAgents Test Analysis Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains comprehensive analysis, execution infrastructure, and improvement roadmaps for the CodeAgents test suite. It was created to systematically examine, execute, and improve the test files `test_models.py` and `test_spaced_repetition.py` from the Training module.

## Structure
- **execution/** - Test execution scripts, results, and summary reports
- **analysis/** - Detailed analysis of test coverage, structure, and dependencies
- **roadmap/** - Improvement roadmap with prioritized action items
- **infrastructure/** - Test runner utilities, configuration, and dependencies

## Usage
1. Run tests: `python test_analysis/infrastructure/run_tests.py`
2. Review analysis: Read markdown files in `analysis/`
3. Follow roadmap: See `roadmap/improvement_roadmap.md` for next steps

## Key Documents
- `execution/execution_summary.md` - Test execution results
- `analysis/test_coverage_analysis.md` - Coverage gaps and recommendations
- `roadmap/improvement_roadmap.md` - Prioritized improvement plan

## Status
- **Current Coverage:** ~30% (needs improvement)
- **Tests Passing:** 0/18 (blocking issues identified)
- **Priority:** HIGH - Critical for code quality assurance
