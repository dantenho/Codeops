# Cursor AI Cooperation Rules

## Worktree Assignments

| Worktree | Focus Area | Branch |
|----------|------------|--------|
| `cursor-frontend` | UI, React, CSS, Components | cursor-frontend |
| `cursor-backend` | API, Database, Services | cursor-backend |
| `cursor-testing` | Tests, QA, CI/CD | cursor-testing |

## Tunneling Protocol

### Message Types
- `task` - Delegate work to another agent
- `response` - Reply to a task
- `sync` - State synchronization
- `heartbeat` - Agent alive signal

### Usage
```python
from tunnel import Tunnel

# Initialize as Cursor
tunnel = Tunnel("cursor")

# Check for tasks from Gemini
messages = tunnel.receive()

# Send response
tunnel.send("gemini", {"status": "completed", "file": "login.py"})
```

### Shared State
Located at `.tunnel/shared_state.json` - used for coordination.

## Guidelines

1. **Stay in your worktree** - Only modify files in your assigned branch
2. **Communicate via tunnel** - Use `.tunnel/` for async messages
3. **Sync before merge** - Broadcast sync message before merging to main
4. **Heartbeat** - Send heartbeat every 5 minutes when active
